I have been interested in the field of robotics since my undergraduate days. My robotics journey started as a member of [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Shital Chiddarwar](https://mec.vnit.ac.in/people/sschiddarwar/)  I am currently working on Learning based dynamics and Optimal Control algorithms for legged robots. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Cyber Physical Systems at [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/). My research advisor is [Prof.Shishir NY](https://www.shishirny.com/)

Also like to take pictures of nature in general and also play chess in my free time.
